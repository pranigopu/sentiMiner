# Extensions using a background service worker
## Project aims
Understand how to create and implement a background service worker, and how to send a message from this service worker to a content script. The aim of this project is mainly conceptual, with minimal complexity in terms of coding.
## Code aims
The code will...
- Respond to the extension icon being clicked
- Display active tab details in the service worker debug console
- Send message to the tab where the icon was clicked

Thi message sent to the tab will reflect on the webpage's debug console, due to a listener present in the content script that will react accordingly.

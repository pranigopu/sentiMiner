# BACKEND NOTES
## Omissions
Didn't need database for this project, so deleted it. Also deleted other automatically generated and (for now) unnecessary files and directories.

## Packages
- backend: contains website (i.e. server) configurations
- alpha: contains code for a particular set of services within the website (i.e. a web application)

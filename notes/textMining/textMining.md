# Text mining
## Definition
Text mining or text analytics is the process of transforming unstructured text into structured, normalized data. Structured data1 implies
1. Standardised format (i.e., format uniformly used for every use case)
2. Well-defined structure
3. Accessible to humans and programs

Data normalization is the organization of data into a more logical structure, which involves:
1. Removing redundancies
2. Data munging (i.e., transforming the data into a more usable format)
3. Grouping data according to shared characteristics

## Purpose
Structuring and normalizing data make complex processes like machine learning more efficient and effective since machine learning relies on data quality and accessibility. For example, structuring and normalizing data can help in:
- Iterating through elements more efficiently (ex. iterating through words)
- Dealing with necessary data (by removing redundancies)
- Generalizing a computational method for a standardized format
- Efficiently accessing necessary metadata (ex. word index, word count)

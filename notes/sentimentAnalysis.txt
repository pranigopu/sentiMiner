TYPES
___
Fine-grained sentiment analysis
--x--
Used when polarity precision (i.e. inclusion of more precise points within a polar scale) is important. Hence, a bipolar scale such as "positive" to "negative" is divided into categories such as:
- Very positive
- Positive
- Neutral
- Negative
- Very negative

Another common application of fine-grained sentiment analysis is on a rating based scale (ex. 5 stars => very positive, 1 star => very negative, and everything in between is defined accordingly).
___
Emotion detection sentiment analysis
--x--
Used to help detect underlying emotions in the data, such as happiness, sadness or anger. Such sentiment analysis may use lexicons that relate various words to the respective emotions, which has its drawbacks, since a word or a set of words may have many different, even constrasting meanings, depending on the context, which can be hard to study and grasp algorithmically.
___
Aspect-based sentiment analysis
--x--
Used to determine not only what the underlying sentiment in the data is, but also what specifically is the sentiment directed towards.

For example, in the sentence, "The customer service was not able to respond to any of my technical needs", aspect-based sentiment analysis may be able to identify that there is a negative sentiment towards customer service.
___
Multilingual sentiment analysis
--x--
As the name suggests, it is used to deal with texts that are or may be in multiple languages. It can also involve language detection.

200,For example Article of the Treaty of Lisbon specifies that If Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power

232,NATO commanders expect obeisance but sometimes need to subordinate their desires or plans to the operators who are themselves subject to sovereign codes of conduct like the UCMJ
233,case in point was the clash between General Sir Mike Jackson and General Wesley Clark over KFOR actions at Pristina Airport
234,NATO commanders can issue orders to their subordinate commanders in the form of operational plans OPLANs operational orders OPORDERs tactical direction or fragmental orders FRAGOs and others
235,The joint rules of engagement must be followed and the Law of Armed Conflict must be obeyed at all times
236,Operational resources remain under national command but have been transferred temporarily to NATO
237,Although these national units through the formal process of transfer of authority have been placed under the operational command and control of NATO commander they never lose their national character

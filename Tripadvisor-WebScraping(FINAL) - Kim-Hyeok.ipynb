      "\n",
      "I have stayed here thrice because my work area is a few doors away. Each time I have had a problem but never has it been this bad. There were cockroaches roaming freely in the room and shower. Almost every thing needs fixing, yellowish stained bed linen, super old towels, Tv that does not work, lights that dont work, Shower fittings that are broken - almost everything needs to be fixed. In all the rooms that I stayed the stem of the ceiling fan touches the false ceiling sending out vibrations that can give you a head ache in a few minutes. I stayed in the pavilion room which is the superior one. You can imagine the condition of the standard rooms.  They seriously need to think about injecting some capital into this property. As of now stay away ! \n",
      "\n",
      "Right from the front desk executive to the manager of the hotel make you feel comfortable with the best of services they have to offer.

      "we reached the hotel at early morning 7 and requested for an early check in. we were a family of 3 . I requested a room atleast just for all of us to relax for a while and the staff immediately gave a club room without any waiting the room was also  was spacious . service is excellent and cleanliness was great . the towels were little worn out .  the bathroom wash basin was choked but they got it repaired immediately.  just being little picky  there was no shaving kit or hair drier in the rooms.  rest all the toiletries and coffee /tea were available   we opted for a standard room non breakfast so didn't try any meals .   there is an excellent supermarket cum cafe few meters away which serves excellent dishes . it's called simply  naamdharis .  location is great , area is \n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here because I had work close by. This budget Hotel is clean but maintenance is poor. Signs of wear and tare are every where. If possible take the larger club room it comes with a balcony. Just a handful of staff maintain this place and they are a nice lot. Quality of breakfast in the small restaurant was erratic. Avoid the Idly which are a disaster. The hotel is in a quiet side road in Jayanagar and there is a nice restaurant and departmental store called Simpli Namdhari about 50 yards away. The linen and bedding badly need to be replaced. I had a convenient stay. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is centrally located and very close to Ashoka pillar. Neat and well maintained. Has a small in house restaurant. Two training rooms which can accommodate 25 to 39 participants are available. Facilities are good. Value for money. \n",

The complimentary breakfast served is good with good options. The location is good in a residential area. App based taxi are readily available. Bus stop is close by, can find autos from the main road. \n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent service.well cleaned and maintained rooms.The staff well trained and very friendly .I must specially mention the receptionist Ms. pallavi name who assured that i get all that i required from the rest of the staff.And must also appreciate the room service staff . they are also very friendly. \n",

      "\n",
      "Stayed here with family , checked-in late night  and first impression of room was good. Few minutes after settling in the room realised bathroom floor was all wet and water from the drainage was all over the floor. Yuk..... We informed Reception and manger was not even bothered to come and talk to us about the issue. He sent one of the staff member who was helpless, he moped the floor and still water was coming out of the drainage... they told us to call reception every time the floor got wet so that staff can wipe all water. What a great idea The Manager gave... Imagine doing it all night... who would want to do it? Room was smelly.. Manager was not even ready to provide different room and was lying all rooms are booked. After yelling on the staff different room was alloted. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff is well groomed with right leadership and this can be experienced from the hospitality we get during the stay. The team arranges excellent service and provides  attention to every details. specially i want to say thanks to  pallavi from front desk because she gives some idea about the nearest place for visit and it was amazing ...wonderila  such a nice place. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had a wonderful time to relax & reenergize between my business meetings . Great service and excellent food .Especially thanks to Front Desk staff. Surely i recommend this Hotel to my Family and friends to book here . I will visit soon to this hotel. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hi,  Here is another corporate review of one of the places I have stayed at during my official trips....   Good... 1. Staff is very cooperative 2. Manager is very cooperative 3. Ambience is Decent 4. Location is Prime for business travellers 5. Accessibility to major parts of the city is good 6. Major facilities are available nearby like Eateries, Medicine shops, Coffee Day etc  Bad.... 1. Food can be moved up a bit in quality 2. Staff needs to be more trained on maintenance of the location 3. Post 11 Pm the kitchen is closed so would be difficult if you have midnight hunger pangs 4. Mosquito's can be a issue if you open the window (but that is off course not a hotel fault)....  Have a good trip... and do press like if you appreciate the review. \n",
      "\n",
      "Had recently visited this place along with  my wife. I must stay at this place is worth cherishing...the staff is very warm and always wore a smile...and special thanks to rajani ,priya and pallavi they were very kind and always there to help. Big thank you to entire team. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a nice comfy hotel. Stayed in club room. Rooms are big, has a balcony. The staff is really courteous. Always ready to be of help. The location is good. It's just walkable distance from a main road and thus the nights are peaceful .. you just need to request for a service and the hotel staff will be ready to help you. If u are looking for a hotel with all bells and whistles then this is not for you .. but if u are looking for a comfortable stay. Which is near to main location and want a peaceful stay then this is the place for you \n",
      "\n",
      "Hi... I have been to Bangalore couple of times and explored multiple properties as well. After exploring I got the chance to experience such a nice property. The construction is quite new and the management is maintaining it so well. They have their in house restaurant which includes variety of food and the staff of both kitchen and house keeping are so friendly. They will go out of the way for customer satisfaction. The room contains all the basic things and hygiene. The location and area is really good and impressive. Everything is nearby and within your reach.Overall it is really a good option to choose. \n",
      "\n",
      "Very beautiful budget hotel. Peaceful area. Stayed during a business tour. Very comfortable and clean room.  And very cooperative staff. Hospitality of Mr Rafael and team is highly appreciable. Will visit soon.  Keep the good work going \n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent hotel I really do had a nice experience there. I love  the food, and I like the services, i like the way the staff talk to their customer with such a respect.

      "\n",
      "A simple budget hotel nestled in the green Jayanagar Ist block with no pretensions. The property was simple yet had all the amenities you can ask for in a good budget hotel except for the staff......  The staff was exceptional! From the GM Raphael Shah to the front office staff of Bikram and team - their hospitality, care and courtesy completely bowled us over! Hats off to such employees - the management are lucky to have them and it would be our pleasure to visit and enjoy this property on future ocassions. \n",
      "\n",
      "When i landed there they had no room which was ready. Was given a room after 15 mins of waiting. The room was not maintained. The balcony door opened by itself and wouldnt lock. The AC had no remote and used to on and off through the MCB switch. The washroom was full of small insects. Many switches and light fittings dont work. In a double room only 1 towel was kept. It takes them a reminder to provide a 2nd one. The breakfast was extremely mediocre and even not replinished on time. The in room dining food was tasteless and chapatis were cold. Not a value for money place at all. Avoid \n",
      "\n",
      "Situated In commercial area of Jayanagar , fantastic Location . Nice neat and clean rooms . Buffet breakfast was good , specially the South Indian Fare . Friendly staff provided quick prompt service. Would recommend. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is a newly opened Hotel , but short of staff.They want to have bookings but unable to provide service.They do not have a chef too and the staff themselves try and make the dishes according to their knowledge. \n",
      "\n",
      "Manager Mr. Sanjeev is the worst person I have seen in the Hotel Industry.  In spite of us having a booking for nearly 15 rooms, the respect/service we got were peanuts. We forced to take back our advance and he wasn't even sorry he lost the big booking.  Water is a problem in the bathroom, Linen is not clean sometimes but the tipping point is the behavior of Mr. Sanjeev.  Please do not book in this hotel. You will repent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rooms we were very dirty. My grandparents stayed in this hotel twice and we did not get hot water in the morning when we wanted to shower. If i call up the reception, the lady said that she cannot do anything as she does  not know what to do. When i spoke to the manager Mr. Sanjeev, he was very very rude and he said you cannot call for every small problem. He told us if we want we can check out. Very very rude of him. He should be fired. \n",
      "\n",
      "A Budget Hotel, in a residential area, would be fine budget tight meetings. Though the courtesy was good, poor service hold one back from base requirements of a budget hotel. Also safety features not taken in mind as no emergency exits visible \n",
      "\n",
      "nice ,well done  small hotel but rooms are very spacious,the location is calm and quite ,not much options for food,neat and clean place,was comfortable as my work place was nearby ,for me it was worth for the price in a city like bengaluru,and that too such central location.would like to come back \n",
      "\n",
      "Could not provide us with the rooms that we had booked almost one month prior. Service was really bad. Manager was abusive and does not know how to speak to customers. I would suggest that one should avoid staying at this place. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed in this hotel around 4-5 weeks due to my business trips. Rooms are clean and neat. Room service is good and have a good experience. Support staff is courteous and helpful. Hotel location is good and near to market and Lalbagh Garden ... \n",
      "\n",
      "Stay was very comfortable,room are were very clean and spacious with good interiors,had a good experience with staff at front office Mr.Lokesh was very courteous and kind enough to welcome,had a homely feeling during my stay, Felt the same experience during my stay at Lords Plaza Surat, Top3 Lords Resorts Bhavanagar, Revival Lords in Vadodara, Food and service team was also very hospitable,would rates it as Value For  Money hotel,would suggest to stay when trvelling to Bangalore in Jayanagar area. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rooms were nice, comfortable and clean. Food was good and so was the service. Hospitable and courteous staff. Convenient location. True value for money. Added advantage being that the market is walking distance. Pleasant weather added to the walking experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Best Service I experienced in Bangalore, The Lords Hotels are fantastic throughout I have experienced; Lords Plaza in Bangalore, Surat and Ankleshwar, the service is extraordinary and very welcoming managers and staff.

We chose to ate at restaurant, took buffet which was well spread with various delicious dishes. Service staff is very caring & courteous, They refill immediately as you finish your last bite or beverage.We had great fine dinning experience. We stayed in four to five Lords hotels and i think lords covers all prime cities. Great Job Lords Hotels & Resorts....! \n",
      "\n",

      "I stayed at this hotel when it was just opening up and had a great experience. The room size if great and so is the location 100%. I had work at Jayanagar and really did not need to spend too much. If you are looking at value for money and also location then this is the right place. Their restaurant would serve all basic items which taste home made. Over all a great stay for the price paid as these guys are reasonable \n",
